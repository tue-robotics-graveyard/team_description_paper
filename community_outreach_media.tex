The Tech United team carries out many promotional activities to promote technology and innovation with children. These activities are carried out by separate teams of student assistants. Tech United often visits primary and secondary schools, public events, trade fairs and have regular TV performances. In 2015 and 2016 together, 100+ demos were given and an estimated 50k were reached through live interaction.
Tech United has also got a very active website (\url{www.techunited.nl}), and interacts on many social media mediums: \href{https://www.facebook.com/techunited}{Facebook}, \href{https://www.youtube.com/user/TechUnited}{YouTube}, \href{https://twitter.com/TechUnited}{Twitter} and \href{https://www.flickr.com/photos/techunited/}{Flickr}. Our robotics videos are often shared on the IEEE video Friday website.
