For us, science doesnâ€™t stop at software simulation. At TUe, our test infrastructure contains real life environments. Here, different room types can be simulated (i.e. home, care institution) and real life products are used. In addition, Tech United carries out many demonstrations per year at different indoor locations throughout the Netherlands. This ensures that our concepts keep being tested. At this point our system are able to operate in dynamic environments used by humans.
