\subsection*{Overview}

In order to interact with the robot aside of speech, a web-based Graphical User Interface (GUI) has been designed. An HTML5 website\footnote{\texttt{https://github.com/tue-robotics/tue\_mobile\_ui}} is hosted on the robotic platform that offers a GUI to multiple users on different platforms with use of a Robot API\footnote{\texttt{https://github.com/tue-robotics/robot-api}} implemented in Javascript. Figure~\ref{fig:webgui_architecture} shows an overview of how the user can interact with the robot via this interface. ToDo: what kind of interaction? --> can you give some examples? Maybe say what the action server does?

The Webserver that is hosting the GUI connects this Robot API to a graphical user interface that is offered to multiple clients on different platforms.}
