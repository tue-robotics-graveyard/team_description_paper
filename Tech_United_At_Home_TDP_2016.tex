\begin{abstract}
%In your abstract, please state which is the main research line of your team for this year (on which problem or set of problems are you focusing all the team efforts). Tell why this research is important, how are you approaching to the problem solution and which results do you expect to obtain.
This paper provides an overview of the main developments of the Tech United Eindhoven RoboCup@Home team. 
Our main research efforts this year have focused on i) fitting furniture objects to update our object-oriented world model, thereby improving localization, navigation and object segmentation ii) developing a WebGUI to provide the user with a platform-independent way to interact with the robot and iii) natural language interpretation to ease the specification of written commands for the robot and to make speech recognition more robust.
