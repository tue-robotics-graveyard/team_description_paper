\begin{abstract}
%In your abstract, please state which is the main research line of your team for this year (on which problem or set of problems are you focusing all the team efforts). Tell why this research is important, how are you approaching to the problem solution and which results do you expect to obtain.
This paper provides an overview of the main developments of the Tech United Eindhoven RoboCup@Home team. ToDo: update. The main research effort of the past year has focused on developing a global, volumetric, object-oriented world model. This world model should replace all world representations that are commonly present in an architecture, e.g., for navigation and manipulation. As a result, these modules can benefit from the additional knowledge that is present in the world model. This world modeling approach is expected to i) make modules such as navigation more robust since these can benefit from the additional knowledge that is present in the world model and ii) reduce the amount of hardcoded knowledge that is commonly present.
