The reasoning layer of the AMIGO ROS based software consists of a set of finite state machines (\href{https://github.com/tue-robotics/robot_smach_states}{robot\_smach\_states}) that build upon the robotâ€™s skill layer (\href{https://github.com/tue-robotics/robot_skills}{robot\_skills}). These state machines are useful if you want the robot to execute some complex plan, where all possible states and state transitions can be described explicitly. The implementation is done with use of the open-source SMACH package. %SMACH is a task-level architecture for rapidly creating complex robot behaviours.
