Tech United takes great pride in creating and maintaining open-source software and hardware to accelerate innovation. Tech United initiated the Robotic Open Platform website\footnote{\url{http://roboticopenplatform.org/}}, to share hardware designs. In terms of software, all our repositories are available on GitHub\footnote{\url{https://github.com/tue-robotics}}. All packages are equipped with documentation and tutorials. Recently, our wrapper for openface was forked by the Toyota Research Institute. Moreover, Tech United and its scientific staff have the capacity to co-develop (+10 people), maintain and assist with questions.
