The \acrshort{ed}-localization plugin\footnote{\url{https://github.com/tue-robotics/ed localization}}  implements Monte Carlo localization  based on the environment description in ED, laserscan readings (sensor\_msgs/Laserscan) and a valid transformation between the /odom and the /base\_link frame of the robot (tf). It does not differ much from the ROS AMCL package\footnote{\url{http://wiki.ros.org/amcl}}; where the AMCL package uses a grid map as representation, the ED-localization plugin uses a 2D render from its world model.
