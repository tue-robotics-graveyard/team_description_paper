In this paper, this year's main developments of Tech United Eindhoven have been discussed: ToDo: update
\begin{itemize}
	\item A new world model has been developed: Environment Descriptor. By combining semantic and volumetric information about the environment, this world model can be used not only for task planning and execution but also for motion planning.
	\item Perception algorithms are implemented as `workers' on world model entities which allows for real-time classification of objects.
	\item One of the benefits of using a volumetric world model is that predefined waypoints have become obsolete. Instead, a goal area can be defined depending on the task and the object at hand, which greatly robustifies navigation.
\end{itemize}
With these improvements, we hope to improve on last year's performance. We are looking forward to RoboCup~2015 in Huefei!
