  journal = {Autonomous Robots},

  volume = {38},
  pages = {1--15},
  number = {1},
  abstract = {Nearly every task a domestic robot could potentially solve requires
	a description of the robot's environment which we call a world model.
	One problem underexposed in the literature is the maintenance of
	world models. Rather than on creating a world model, this work focuses
	on finding a strategy that determines when to update which object
	in the world model. The decision whether or not to update an object
	is based on the expected information gain obtained by the update,
	the action cost of the update and the task the robot performs. The
	proposed strategy is validated during both simulations and real world
	experiments. The extended series of simulations is performed to show
	both the performance gain with respect to a benchmark strategy and
	the effect of the various parameters. The experiments show the proposed
	approach on different set-ups and in different environments.},

  title = {A Representation Method Based on the Probability of Collision for
	Safe Robot Navigation in Domestic Environments},
  booktitle = {Proc. IEEE/RSJ Int. Conf. on Intelligent
	Robots and Systems},
  year = {2014},
  abstract = {This paper introduces a three-dimensional volumetric representation
	for safe navigation. It is based on a representation framework that
	probabilistically fuses sensor measurements to represent the occupancy
	probability of volumes. To achieve safe navigation in a domestic
	environment this representation is extended with a model of the occupancy
	probability if no sensor measurements are received and a model to
	deal with unpredictably moving obstacles that can arise from behind
	occlusions by always expecting obstacles to appear on the robots
	path. By combining the occupancy probability of volumes with the
	position uncertainty of the robot, a probability of collision is
	obtained. It is shown that by relating this probability to a safe
	velocity limit a robot in a real domestic environment can move close
	to a certain maximum velocity but decides to attain a slower safe
	velocity limit when it must, analogous to velocity limits and warning
	signs in traffic.},

	using hierarchical action representations},
  booktitle = {16th Int. Conf. on Advanced Robotics},
  year = {2013},
  pages = {1--7},
  abstract = {The aim of the RoboEarth project is to develop a globally accessible
	database, that enables service robots to share reusable information
	relevant to the execution of their daily tasks. Examples of this
	information are the hierarchical task descriptions, or action recipes,
	that represent typical household tasks as symbolic action sequences.
	By annotating these static action representations with hierarchical
	planner predicates, they can be interpreted by a Hierarchical Task
	Network planner such as SHOP2 to compose optimized robot plans in
	a flexible manner, based on the actual state of the environment and
	the available capabilities of the robot. To subsequently execute
	these plans in a household environment, the CRAM executive toolbox
	is adopted, allowing a tight integration between plan execution and
	the run-time inference of dynamically updated environment knowledge.
	This paper presents the integration of these two planning and execution
	components into one cohesive framework, tailored for the safe execution
	of abstract tasks in challenging household environments. The resulting
	framework is implemented on the AMIGO service robot and a basic experiment
	is conducted to demonstrate the frameworks integral functionality.},

	method for solving the data association problem in modem multiple

	for MHT, the basic principles behind
	
	MHT and the alternative implementations in common use. It discusses
	the manner in which the multiple data association hypotheses formed
	by MHT can be combined with multiple filter models, such as used
	by the interacting multiple model (IMM)
	
	method. An overview of the studies that show the advantages of MHT
