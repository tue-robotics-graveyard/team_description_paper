\begin{abstract}
This paper provides an overview of the main developments of the Tech United Eindhoven RoboCup@Home team. Tech United uses an advanced world modeling representation system called the Environment Descriptor that allows straight forward implementation of localization, navigation, exploration, object detection \& recognition, object manipulation and robot-robot cooperation skills. Recently developments are improved object detection via deep learning methods, a generic GUI for different user levels, improved speech recognition and improved natural language interpretation. These developments are done on AMIGO and SERGIO and will now also be implemented on the Toyota HSR.
